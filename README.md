# Readme Generator

## Description 
I have created a README generator using inquirer. This readme is generated in the command line by going through a prompt. After you answer the prompt questions it will generate a readme.md

## Installation
To run this application in the command line you will have to NPM Install to install the inquirer package and node index.js. From there you can answer the prompt
